Logic

	count frequencies
	make linked list
	make binary tree nodes by traversing linked list
	make hash table of codes with char's as keys

	use header to decode

Data Structures

	node
        typedef struct Node{
    		int letter;
                int frequency;
		struct Node *next;
	        struct Node *left;
                struct Node *right;

	} Node;

Algorithms
Methods

	linkedNode *make_linked(char freq[]);
	linkedNode *insert_sort(linkedNode *head, char c, int freq);
	void encode(char *chars[], Node *root, char *code);
	void decode(char *chars[], FILE *file);

Testing

	diff'ing original and decoded
        diff'ing encoded and original to see how much it was reduced
